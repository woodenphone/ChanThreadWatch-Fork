# ChanThreadWatch Fork
This is a program for saving threads from 4chan and other similar sites.
Each different version of a thread the program sees is saved with a timestamp to allow retention of deleted posts.

Updates, previous versions, etc. are available at the GitHub page

This fork was created to add more features and fix broken ones.


If you find this helpful and know enough C#, feel free to fork this and make it better.
It's basically what I'm doing.
